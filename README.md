# Final_Project_Sass_HTML5
This is a final Project,  try to copy 3 pages  of this website https://buildonauts.com/en, just using HTML5 and SASS, make responsive using bootstrap Flex.

It was a project in which I had a lot of fun and I learned how to arrange the elements with the box model using flexbox, also the use of SaSS helped me to have a more comfortable code and easy to read and refactor
